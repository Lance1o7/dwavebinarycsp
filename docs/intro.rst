Introduction
============

`dwavebinarycsp` is a library to construct a binary quadratic :term:`model` from a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP) with small constraints over binary variables (represented
as either binary values {0, 1} or spin values {-1, 1}).

For an introduction to CSPs, see :std:doc:`Constraints <oceandocs:concepts/csp>`.

Example: Solving a Map-Coloring CSP
===================================

The map-coloring CSP, for example, is to assign a color to each region of a map such that
any two regions sharing a border have different colors.

   Coloring a map of Canada with four colors.

The constraints for the map-coloring problem can be expressed as follows:

* Each region is assigned one color only, of :math:`C` possible colors.
* The color assigned to one region cannot be assigned to adjacent regions.

Solving such problems as the map-coloring CSP on a :term:`sampler` such as the
D-Wave system necessitates that the
mathematical formulation use binary variables because the solution is implemented physically
with qubits, and so must translate to spins :math:`s_i\in\{-1,+1\}` or equivalent binary
values :math:`x_i\in \{0,1\}`. This means that in formulating the problem
by stating it mathematically, you might use unary encoding to represent the :math:`C` colors:
each region is represented by :math:`C` variables, one for each possible color, which
is set to value :math:`1` if selected, while the remaining :math:`C-1` variables are
:math:`0`.



This example finds a solution to the map-coloring problem for a map of Canada
using four colors. Canada's 13 provinces are denoted by postal codes:

The workflow for solution is as follows:

#. Formulate the problem as a graph, with provinces represented as nodes and shared borders as edges,
   using 4 binary variables (one per color) for each province.
#. Create a binary constraint satisfaction problem and add all the needed constraints.
#. Convert to a binary quadratic model.
#. Sample.
#. Plot a valid solution, if such was found.

The following sample code creates a graph of the map with provinces as nodes and
shared borders between provinces as edges (e.g., "('AB', 'BC')" is an edge representing
the shared border between British Columbia and Alberta). It creates a binary constraint
satisfaction problem based on two types of constraints:

* :code:`csp.add_constraint(one_color_configurations, variables)` represents the constraint
  that each node (province) select a single color, as represented by valid configurations
  :code:`one_color_configurations = {(0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0, 0)}`
* :code:`csp.add_constraint(not_both_1, variables)` represents the constraint that
  two nodes (provinces) with a shared edge (border) not both select the same color.

The plot shows a solution returned by the D-Wave solver. No provinces sharing a border

   provinces connected by edges representing shared borders. No two nodes connected by
   an edge share a color.
